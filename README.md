# Cohort 10 - Nashville Software School
___

As recent graduate of [NSS Cohort 7](http://cohort7.nashvillesoftwareschool.com/), I am continuing my journey by giving back to the next few cohorts of students, and along the way I am solidifying my knowledge of the technologies I will be using to become truly independent and free.

This repo will detail my interpretation of the new and exciting cirriculum that NSS has recently adopted. I look forward to sharing my solutions with our newest software developers.
