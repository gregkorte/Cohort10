# Music History
You will be building the basic structure of your Music History application in HTML and making it look good with the skills you learned in CSS.

## Part 1:
Visit the Music History mockup and create a new Pen on Codepen and make your own page that looks exactly like the one shown there.

####Criteria

1. Create five options for the artist select element of any artist that you enjoy.
2. Create at least five options for the album select element. One, or more, album for each artist.
3. The links in the navigation bar don't need to link to anything just yet, you can use <a href="#">View music</a> for now
4. Pick your four favorite songs from the artists you have chosen and use the information for each in the list that's on the right-hand side.
