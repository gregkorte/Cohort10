#JavaScript 101 - Part 1

##Challenges

Do at least 3 different challenges that makes them create variables, perform math functions, and check boolean expressions.

1. How many hours are in a year?
2. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. How many seconds old they are?
4. If they are older than some arbitrary number, alert "I'm old", else "I'm young"?

Do 4 different challenges that start at different initial values, use different evaluation punctuation (>, <, <=, >=), and increment/decrement the counter by different amounts.

1. Write a for loop that increments the counter variable by 10 each time, and displays the value.
2. Write a for loop that divides the counter variable by 2 each time, and displays the value.
3. Augment the loop to insert each new value into an array
4. Write a loop that starts at 100 and decrements a variable by 1. If the number is even, add the number to the beginning of an array, else add it to the end of the array.

#JavaScript 101 - Part 2

In this part, create a full, but basic, web document that combines the HTML and the JavaScript - both inline and via an external link - and open it up in Chrome.

1. Grab the resources/__basic.html, copy it into the js-101 directory, and rename it as index.html.
2. Create a script element before the closing body tag, and put some basic JS in there that logs to the console, or creates an alert box, whatever you like.
3. Do colored reindeer exercise:
    - a. Loop through all the reindeer in the array, and add the 
    name of the reindeer to the single HTML div element provided.
    - b. The name of the reindeer should be prepended with the corresponding
    color from the other array.
         - For example:
            Blue Dashe
            Red Dancer
            etc..
4. Do vegetables and boy bands exercise:
    - a. Get a reference to the appropriate DOM element for bands
    - b. Get a reference to the appropriate DOM element for vegetables
    - c. Add the band names into the correct div
    - d. Add the veggie names into the correct div
5. Write a program that loops over an array of student grades (values from 50-100) and outputs how many of each grades there are. 50-60=F, 61-70=D, 71-80=C, 81-90=B, 91-100=A.

    - Start with array of random scores: var scores = [82, 71, 95, 55, 98, 69, 72, 78, 84, 64, 58, 87];
    - How many of each grade?
    - What is the lowest grade?
    - What is the highest grade?

##Challenges
1. What is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder?
2. Write a Fibonacci number generator that outputs the numbers in the series that are less than 500.
3. What is the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers, and the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers?
