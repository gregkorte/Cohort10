##Challenges

Do at least 3 different challenges that makes them create variables, perform math functions, and check boolean expressions.

1. How many hours are in a year?
2. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. How many seconds old they are?
4. If they are older than some arbitrary number, alert "I'm old", else "I'm young"?

Do 4 different challenges that start at different initial values, use different evaluation punctuation (>, <, <=, >=), and increment/decrement the counter by different amounts.

1. Write a for loop that increments the counter variable by 10 each time, and displays the value.
2. Write a for loop that divides the counter variable by 2 each time, and displays the value.
3. Augment the loop to insert each new value into an array
4. Write a loop that starts at 100 and decrements a variable by 1. If the number is even, add the number to the beginning of an array, else add it to the end of the array.
