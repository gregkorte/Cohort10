##SolarSystem Exercise

###Part 1

2. Getter/setter for number of planets that humans have landed people or robots on.
3. Public property for holding a last modified date.
4. Getter/setter for spacecraft currently exploring solar system. These should be stored in a private array.
5. Any other fun/related data that the student wants to add.

###Part 2
Create a new JS file for the solar system application that augments the SolarSystem module you created in the initial JS file.

1. Getter for an array of closest 5 stars to the Sun.
2. Getter/setter for the estimated age of the solar system in earth years.
3. Getter/setter for array of known dwarf planets.
