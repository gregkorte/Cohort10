The DotNet Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn .NET. The goal is to learn 
a .NET language (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc), syntax, structure and some common functions and libraries.

The DotNet Koans came about because of the most enlightened RubyKoans (github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) 
and follow the structure of it most closely.

To get started, run the AutoKoanRunner from either PowerShell or cmd. Fix the test highlighted in red
to walk the path to enlightenment.
